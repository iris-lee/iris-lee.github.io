                    <h2>INFINITY</h2>
                    <p>I remember being very proud when I memorized the first ten digits, and then the first hundred, and then the first hundred in Chinese. I also remember when my teacher told me that no matter how long I counted, I would never be able to come to a conclusion, as there was no such thing as the "biggest number". There isn't much else I can tell you about infinity, as I still get nightmares about counting to this day, but I can leave you with some facts relating to numbers:
                    <br>
                    <u>Did you know?</u>
                    <br>
                    A centillion is 10^303
                    <br>
                    Googolplex is 10^10^100
                    <br>
                    Written out in ordinary decimal notation, this is 1 followed by 10^100 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol of zeroes.
                    <br>
                    Google now processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average, which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide, which is almost nothing in comparison to their namesake.</p>

                    <h2>CONSPIRACY THEORIES</h2>
                    <p>
                    <u>Conspiracy theory currently on the mind:</u>
                    <br>
                    Project MKUltra: the CIA's Mind Control Program
                    <br>
                    Although initially seen as another fanciful conspiracy theory, this one turned out to be true. The CIA really did run secret mind-control experiments on American citizens from the 1950s until 1973, using "electronics, hypnosis, sensory deprivation and verbal and sexual abuse". In 1995, President Bill Clinton issued a formal apology for Project MKUltra, as it was known. It is believed that 'Unabomber' Theodore Kaczynski was part of these experiments, although that detail has yet to be confirmed.

                    <u>Did you know?</u>
                    <br>
                    There are roughly 4,200 religions practiced world-wide.
                    <br>    
                    There are around 33,000 denominations of Christianity.
                    <br>
                    While many U.S. religious groups are aging, the unaffiliated are comparatively young – and getting younger, on average, over time. As a rising cohort of highly unaffiliated Millennials reaches adulthood, the median age of unaffiliated adults has dropped to 36, down from 38 in 2007 and far lower than the general (adult) population’s median age of 46.4 By contrast, the median age of mainline Protestant adults in the new survey is 52 (up from 50 in 2007), and the median age of Catholic adults is 49 (up from 45 seven years earlier).</p>

					<h2>BLACK HOLES</h2>
					<p>
                    <u>Did you know?</u>
                    <br>
                    You can’t directly see a black hole.
                    <br>
                    Because a black hole is indeed “black” — no light can escape from it — it’s impossible for us to sense the hole directly through our instruments, no matter what kind of electromagnetic radiation you use (light, X-rays, whatever.) The key is to look at the hole’s effects on the nearby environment, points out NASA. Say a star happens to get too close to the black hole, for example. The black hole naturally pulls on the star and rips it to shreds. When the matter from the star begins to bleed toward the black hole, it gets faster, gets hotter and glows brightly in X-rays.
                    <br>
                    The center of the milky way is most likely a supermassive blackhole.
                    <br>
                    A natural next question is given how dangerous a black hole is, is Earth in any imminent danger of getting swallowed? The answer is no, astronomers say, although there is probably a huge supermassive black hole lurking in the middle of our galaxy. Luckily, we’re nowhere near this monster — we are about two-thirds of the way out from the center, relative to the rest of our galaxy — but we can certainly observe its effects from afar. For example: the European Space Agency says it’s four million times more massive than our Sun, and that it’s surrounded by surprisingly hot gas.</p>

					<h2>BOOKS</h2>
					<p>Honestly I haven't been reading as much as I wish did. I would like to say it's because I've been so busy, but I think it's actually just because I have a short attention span, which worries me. The current book that I have been reading is <u>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion</u> by Jonathan Haidt.</p>
